<p>I have been involved with technology since I first got my hands on a computer when I was eight years old. Since then I have actively kept up with as much technology as I can handle. Outside of the world of coding I am an avid gamer. I am both a console owner and PC user, ranging from Xbox 1 to Nitendo Switch to League of Legends.</p>
<p>Taking another step away from computers comes my passion for sports. I grew up playing sports, but in the end I fell in love with soccer. Barcelona is my La Liga team while across the sea, Manchester United holds my EPL slot. Rock climbing is a hobby I took up last year and have enoyed it tremednously. It is a sport in which puzzle solving is at its finest, it is you against the wall and there is a solution, you just need to find it.</p>
<p>Traveling is another hobby I enjoy. The desire to experience new culture and be immeresed in a new environment ranging from langauge, architecture, land, climate, art, people, and food.</p>
